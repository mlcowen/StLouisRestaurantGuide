# St. Louis Restaurant Guide

This web application was created as a project for LaunchCode's Liftoff program. The application is a restaurant guide for Saint Louis, MO. The goal is to promote our local food scene, while encouraging users to try new restaurants. My hope is that this will make searching for dining out options easier. 

 Features include:
 - Searching and filtering restaurants by categories.
 - Research individual restaurants by viewing details on restaurant landing pages. 
 - Save restaurants to a user's custom list. Helping users to remember the locations they wanted to try.
 - Add reviews to restaurants.
